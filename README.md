## 🎮 Game Rules

* This is a **two-player** game.
* **Player 1** controls their paddle using the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys.
* **Player 2** controls their paddle using the `W` (up) and `S` (down) keys.
* Every time a player **misses the ball**, the opponent **gains a point**.
* There is **no predefined end** — play as long as you like.
* But beware: **each point increases the ball speed**, challenging your reflexes even more!
